# BPM Detector

This project tracks beats from audio files.

## Debugging

Any debugging logs should be stored in the `logs/` directory, which is listed in `.gitignore` so it isn't committed. Create the directory if it doesn't exist:

```sh
mkdir -p logs
```

Log files placed here will be ignored by Git.
